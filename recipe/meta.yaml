  summary: 'PythonQwt: Qt plotting widgets for Python'
  description: |
    The PythonQwt project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- the
    obsolescence issue of PyQwt (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) which is
    no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the original Qwt C++ code
    to Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new
    modules based on NumPy and other libraries.
